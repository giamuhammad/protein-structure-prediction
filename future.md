# Project Future - MiniFold

In a brief way, some promising ideas:

* Train with crops of 64x64, not windows of 200x200 (and average at prediction time).
* Use data from Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSA) such as paired changes bewteen AAs.
* Use distance map as potential input for angle prediction (or vice versa?).
* Use Physicochemical features of AAs as input.
* Train with more data (in the cloud?)
* Use predictions as constraints to the Rosetta Method for Protein Structure Prediction 
* ...

*"Science is a Work In Progress."*
